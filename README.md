# FIFA18 Auto Res

Fifa18AutoRes is a simple python script, that launch fifa 18, and automatically set the resolution of the game as the current monitor resolution.

This is really useful, if you, like me, play the game on different screens with different resolution (Ultrawide monitor and a tv for example), as this script will edit the fifa config file, and set the correct resolution.

To use the script just download the zip from the repo files, extract it, change the paths with yours on the settings.ini file, and start the exe file.
